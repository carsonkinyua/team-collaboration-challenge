# 💡 Reflection & Insights – GitHub Profile Optimization

## 🧑‍💻 Name: Mike Waweru (WECK-web)

## 🧠 What I Learned
- I learned how to create and edit a profile-level `README.md`
- I learned how to use Shields.io to add badges for my skills and tools
- I discovered how to use GitHub stats cards to make my profile look professional
- I understood how to pin repositories and use visitor counters

## 💪 What I Improved
- My GitHub profile is now cleaner and more professional
- I added relevant badges, stats, and pinned repos to show my work
- I added a short personal bio that tells people who I am

## 😅 Challenges I Faced
- I struggled to find the "main" branch at first (I only saw "master")
- I didn’t understand how pinned repos worked until I got help
- I wasn’t sure where to place certain markdown code in the README

## 🔁 What I Would Do Differently
- I would explore more Shields.io and GitHub Actions features
- I would make a banner image or animated GIF for more visual appeal
- I would add more projects to pin on my profile in future

## ✅ Conclusion
This was a valuable learning experience. I now feel confident editing my GitHub profile and will keep improving it as I grow as a developer.
